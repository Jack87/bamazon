# Bamazon™

### Premium CLI shopping experience

Browsers. Mice. *Graphical user interfaces*. Bah!

Who needs 'em!?

Bamazon™ is a streamlined, minimalist shopping experience that leverages the most powerful interface on the planet: the mother-grabbin' command line.

Sure, it's cumbersome. And yeah, you can't actually *see* what you're going to buy. But hey — check out those *sexy tables!*
